This depository contains code and resources associated with the 2023 Idaho Chapter of The Wildlife Society R Workshop, Feb. 14 2023. 

RStudio is a powerful open-source statistical computing software that can enhance the lives of wildlife
students and professionals. However, new users are often intimidated by the learning curve associated
with studying a programming language and novices tend to lose interest if they do not benefit from their new skills. This introduction to R is designed by Data Carpentry for participants with no programming experience and assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio. The first half of the workshop will begin with the basics of R syntax, the RStudio interface, and then introduce importing and manipulating data from CSV files as well as calculating summary statistics. The second half will introduce plotting and visualizing data as well as a brief synopsis on visualizing geographic and spatial data.

To ask any follow-up questions related to the workshop or general help in R, post in the [Issues](https://github.com/r2j2ritson/ICTWS_RWorkshop/issues) tab.
